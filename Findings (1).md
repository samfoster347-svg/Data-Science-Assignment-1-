Interpretation of V1

The graphs show that female students tend to score slightly higher on reading tests than male students. The opposite is true for math scores, where male students tend to score higher. 
The range of scores for female students is wider for female students than male. For example in reading scores, while on average female students score higher than male students, the 
lowest scoring female student scored lower than the lowest male student. Similarly the lowest scoring male student scored higher than the lowest female student in math as well. 

Interpretation of V2

The graphs show that students who completed the test preparation course scored higher on average in math  than those who did not. The differnce in median scores is somewhat small. The range of scores is 
more significant, with the lowest scoring of those that did not complete the course scoring much lower than those that did. This could suggest that the test preparation has a positive effect on math scores. 
However, there are other factors that could be affecting the results which are not captured by the data, for example the ecconomic background of the students which could affect the availability of test prepartion cources. 

Interpretation of V3

The graphs show a general pattern of students on the standard lunch plan scoring higher on average than those on the free/reduced plans. There is no difference based 
on the subject of the test, each group scored similarly regardless of subject, aside from math where those in reduced/free plans scored slightly lower.Again, the ranges 
of the scores are wider for those on the free/reduced plan than the standard plan. This could suggest that the economic factors as suggested in the interpretation of V2 
could be impacting test scores. More research should be done on the impact of economic factors on accedemic performance.

Interpretation of V4

This chart shows a strong positive correlation between scores of all three subjects. This implies a general tendancy that students score highly in one subject tend to score highly in all 
other subjects. This could show that inteligence generalized rather than specialized, in the sense that if a student is good in one subject they are likely to be good most others. There is 
an obvious relationship between reading and writing skills, but the correlation with math scores is less obvious and would make sense if intelegence was generalized across subjects. Research 
could look into this by testing across many age groups and across many subjects.

Interpretation of V5

This chart shows similar information to V4 and V2. It again shows a strong positive correlation between reading and math test scores. It also shows that those that completed a test preparation course 
scored higher on average than those who did not. The lines of best fit are almost exactly the same in terms of slope, meaning that regardless of whether a student took a test preparation course their 
scores likely going to be similar across both tests. This chart also shows that test preparation courses are generally benefitial for both math and reading scores, as their average scores are higher 
for both.
